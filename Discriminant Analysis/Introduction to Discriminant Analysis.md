# Discriminant Analysis

## Definition
Discriminant Analysis is a supervised classification technique used to predict group membership based on observed features.

It finds a linear combination of predictor variables (like age, income, test scores) that best separates observations into predefined classes (like pass/fail, spam/not spam, diseased/healthy).

## Use of Discriminant Analysis in Research

During a study, researchers often encounter critical questions such as:

- **Are the groups different?**
- **On what variables are the groups most different?**
- **Can we predict which group a person belongs to based on measurable variables?**

Discriminant Analysis is a statistical tool that helps answer these questions effectively.

### When Do We Use Discriminant Analysis?

Discriminant Analysis is used when:

- The **dependent variable** is **categorical** (i.e., it represents group labels or categories).
- The **independent variables** are **interval** or **ratio scale** (quantitative variables).

### Purpose of Discriminant Analysis

Discriminant Analysis serves three major purposes:

1. **Group Separation**:  
   It determines whether there are **statistically significant differences** between the groups based on independent variables.

2. **Variable Identification**:  
   It identifies **which variables** contribute the most to the separation of groups.

3. **Classification**:  
   It creates **discriminant functions** that can **predict group membership** of new cases based on observed variables.

### What Does Discriminant Analysis Do?

- It **builds one or more functions** (called discriminant functions) using independent variables.
- These functions are **linear combinations** of predictor variables.
- The goal is to **maximize the separation** between the predefined groups.

### Evaluating a Discriminant Analysis

Discriminant Analysis not only builds classification rules, but also:

- Tests for **significant differences** among groups.
- Measures **classification accuracy** (how well the model classifies cases into correct groups).
- Tells us **how many categories** the dependent variable contains and how well they are separated.
