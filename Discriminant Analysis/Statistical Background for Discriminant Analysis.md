## ðŸ§© Types Based on Number of Variables

### ðŸŸ  3. Univariate Analysis

**Definition**:  
Analysis involving **only one variable**.

**Examples**:
- Finding the average salary of employees.
- Creating a bar chart of student counts in departments.

---

### ðŸŸ  4. Bivariate Analysis

**Definition**:  
Analysis involving **two variables**, usually to find relationships.

**Examples**:
- Study time vs exam score.
- Correlation between height and weight.

---

### ðŸŸ  5. Multivariate Analysis

**Definition**:  
Analysis involving **more than two variables** at the same time.

**Examples**:
- Predicting student performance using study hours, attendance, and past marks.
- Classifying customer types using age, income, and purchase frequency.

## ðŸ”· Bivariate Statistical Techniques

### ðŸ”¹ 6. Correlation

**Definition**:  
Measures how **strongly two variables are related**.

**Examples**:
- Positive correlation: Height and weight.
- Negative correlation: TV hours and exam score.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. Regression

**Definition**:  
Predicts the value of a dependent variable using one or more independent variables.

- **Simple Regression**: One predictor  
  _Example_: Predicting weight using height.

- **Multivariate Regression**: Multiple predictors  
  _Example_: Predicting house price using area, number of rooms, and location.
