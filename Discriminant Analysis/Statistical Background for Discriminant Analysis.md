# ðŸ“˜ Statistical Background for Discriminant Analysis

This document introduces essential statistical concepts used as the foundation for understanding **Discriminant Analysis**. 
The concepts are organized clearly with definitions and examples for easy understanding.

## ðŸŸ¢ 1. Descriptive Statistics

**Definition**:  
Descriptive statistics are methods used to **summarize or describe** the main features of a dataset.

**Examples**:
- Average height of students in a class.
- Most common blood group in a survey.
- Spread of marks in an exam using standard deviation.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ 2. Inferential Statistics

**Definition**:  
Inferential statistics involve using **a sample to make conclusions or predictions** about a larger population.

**Examples**:
- Estimating the percentage of people in a city who prefer electric cars using a survey of 100 people.
- Testing if a new teaching method improves student performance using a sample class.

## ðŸ§© Types Based on Number of Variables

### ðŸŸ  3. Univariate Analysis

**Definition**:  
Analysis involving **only one variable**.

**Examples**:
- Finding the average salary of employees.
- Creating a bar chart of student counts in departments.

---

### ðŸŸ  4. Bivariate Analysis

**Definition**:  
Analysis involving **two variables**, usually to find relationships.

**Examples**:
- Study time vs exam score.
- Correlation between height and weight.

---

### ðŸŸ  5. Multivariate Analysis

**Definition**:  
Analysis involving **more than two variables** at the same time.

**Examples**:
- Predicting student performance using study hours, attendance, and past marks.
- Classifying customer types using age, income, and purchase frequency.

## ðŸ”· Bivariate Statistical Techniques

### ðŸ”¹ 6. Correlation

**Definition**:  
Measures how **strongly two variables are related**.

**Examples**:
- Positive correlation: Height and weight.
- Negative correlation: TV hours and exam score.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. Regression

**Definition**:  
Predicts the value of a dependent variable using one or more independent variables.

- **Simple Regression**: One predictor  
  _Example_: Predicting weight using height.

- **Multivariate Regression**: Multiple predictors  
  _Example_: Predicting house price using area, number of rooms, and location.

### ðŸ”¹ 8. Factor Analysis

**Definition**:  
Reduces a large number of variables into a smaller set of underlying factors.

**Example**:
- Reducing 20 personality test questions into 3 main traits: introversion, stability, curiosity.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 9. Cluster Analysis

**Definition**:  
Groups similar data points into clusters without predefined labels.

**Examples**:
- Grouping customers based on purchase behavior.
- Clustering diseases based on symptoms.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 10. Discriminant Analysis

**Definition**:  
Used to classify observations into **predefined groups** using predictor variables.

**Examples**:
- Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
- Classifying tumors as benign or malignant.
