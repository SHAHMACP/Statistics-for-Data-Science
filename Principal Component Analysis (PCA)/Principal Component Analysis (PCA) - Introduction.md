# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an **unsupervised machine learning** technique used for **dimensionality reduction**. 
- It transforms a dataset with potentially correlated features into a set of linearly uncorrelated features, called **principal components**, with the help of an orthogonal transformation.
- It is one of the popular tools that is used for Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and Predictive modeling.

## Why PCA?

- To reduce high-dimensional data to lower dimensions
- To **visualize** data in 2D or 3D
- To **remove noise** and redundant features
- To **speed up** machine learning models by reducing the number of input features
- To **reduce overfitting**
