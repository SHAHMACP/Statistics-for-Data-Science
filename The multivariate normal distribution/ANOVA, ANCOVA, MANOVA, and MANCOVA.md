# ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA, and MANCOVA

This repository explains four related statistical methods using a clear structure:  
**Method ‚Üí Simple Definition ‚Üí Real-World Example**

---

## üîπ 1. ANOVA ‚Äì *Analysis of Variance*

Compares the **means of one dependent variable** across **two or more independent groups**.

**Example:**  
A school tests whether three different teaching methods (A, B, C) lead to different **math test scores** among students.

> - IV: Teaching Method  
> - DV: Math Test Score  
> - ‚û§ Use ANOVA to check if the average scores differ between groups.

---

## üîπ 2. ANCOVA ‚Äì *Analysis of Covariance*

Compares **group means** of one outcome **while adjusting for another variable (covariate)** that also influences the outcome.

**Example:**  
You want to compare the **math test scores** of students taught using methods A, B, and C ‚Äî but students started with different **previous GPA** levels.

> - IV: Teaching Method  
> - DV: Math Test Score  
> - Covariate: Previous GPA  
> - ‚û§ Use ANCOVA to control for GPA before comparing test scores.

---

## üîπ 3. MANOVA ‚Äì *Multivariate Analysis of Variance*

Tests group differences for **two or more dependent variables** at the same time, **considering their relationships**.

**Example:**  
You compare teaching methods A, B, and C to see their effect on both **math test scores** and **class attendance rates**.

> - IV: Teaching Method  
> - DVs: Math Score, Attendance %  
> - ‚û§ Use MANOVA to analyze combined outcomes together.

---

## üîπ 4. MANCOVA ‚Äì *Multivariate Analysis of Covariance*

Extends MANOVA by **including covariates** ‚Äî tests group differences across multiple dependent variables while **controlling for other variables**.

**Example:**  
You evaluate how teaching methods A, B, and C affect both **math scores** and **attendance**, while controlling for **previous GPA**.

> - IV: Teaching Method  
> - DVs: Math Score, Attendance %  
> - Covariate: Previous GPA  
> - ‚û§ Use MANCOVA to see real group differences after adjusting for GPA.

| ANOVA     | 1     | ‚ùå No      | Compare one outcome across groups                                      |
| ANCOVA    | 1     | ‚úÖ Yes     | Compare one outcome across groups, adjusting for a covariate           |

## What is a Covariate?

> A **covariate** is a continuous variable that **influences the outcome** but is **not part of the group comparison**.  
> Example: A student's **previous GPA** can affect test scores but isn‚Äôt related to the teaching method itself.

## Alternate Example: Exercise, Diet, and Weight Loss

A health researcher wants to evaluate the effects of **exercise programs** and **diet types** on participants‚Äô **weight loss**, **BMI**, and **cholesterol level**.

The researcher also records **baseline weight** before the program starts.

---

### üîπ ANOVA

 **Question:**  
> Does the **type of exercise program** affect **weight loss**?

- IV: Exercise Program (e.g., Cardio, Strength, Yoga)  
- DV: Weight Loss  
- ‚û§ Use **One-Way ANOVA** to test for group mean differences

---

### üîπ ANCOVA

 **Question:**  
> Does the **type of exercise program** affect **weight loss**, **after adjusting for baseline weight**?

- IV: Exercise Program  
- DV: Weight Loss  
- Covariate: Initial (pre-program) weight  
- ‚û§ Use **ANCOVA** to remove baseline influence before comparing programs

---

### üîπ MANOVA

 **Question:**  
> Do different **exercise programs** affect multiple outcomes like **weight loss**, **BMI**, and **cholesterol**?

- IV: Exercise Program  
- DVs: Weight Loss, BMI, Cholesterol  
- ‚û§ Use **MANOVA** to evaluate combined health effects

---

### üîπ MANCOVA

 **Question:**  
> Do exercise programs affect **weight loss, BMI, and cholesterol**, after controlling for **initial weight**?

- IV: Exercise Program  
- DVs: Weight Loss, BMI, Cholesterol  
- Covariate: Baseline weight  
- ‚û§ Use **MANCOVA** to get accurate group comparisons while controlling for weight

---

## You Can Also Add a Second IV ‚Üí Two-Way Versions

- Add **Diet Type** as a second IV (e.g., High Protein, Low Carb, Balanced)  
- Then apply:
  - **Two-Way ANOVA**: Exercise √ó Diet ‚Üí Weight Loss  
  - **Two-Way MANOVA**: Exercise √ó Diet ‚Üí [Weight Loss, BMI, Cholesterol]  
  - **Two-Way MANCOVA**: Add covariate (e.g., baseline weight or age)
