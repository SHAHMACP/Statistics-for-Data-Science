# Regression Models and Conditional Distributions

Regression models are powerful tools used to understand and predict the relationship between a **dependent variable** (often $Y$) and one or more **independent variables** (often $X$). These models predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

## What Is a Regression Model?

A **regression model** attempts to estimate:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y \mid X] = f(X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X
$$

Where:
- $Y$ is the dependent or output variable
- $X$ is the independent or input variable(s)
- $f(X)$ is a function, often assumed to be linear in basic models



And it assumes the **conditional distribution** of $Y$ given $X$ is **normal**:

$$
Y \mid X = x \sim \mathcal{N}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x, \sigma^2)
$$

That is, for a fixed value of $X$, the values of $Y$ follow a **normal distribution** centered at the regression line.

## Example: Predicting House Prices

Let’s say you're predicting house prices based on square footage.

- Let $X$ = square footage  
- Let $Y$ = house price

The model assumes:

$$
Y \mid X = x \sim \mathcal{N}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x, \sigma^2)
$$

So for houses with 1500 sqft, prices are **normally distributed** around a **mean predicted by the regression line**.

## Conditional Distribution in Bivariate Normal

From the bivariate normal theory, we know:

If

$$
(X, Y) \sim BVN\left(
\begin{bmatrix} \mu_X \\ \mu_Y \end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_X^2 & \rho \sigma_X \sigma_Y \\
\rho \sigma_X \sigma_Y & \sigma_Y^2
\end{bmatrix}
\right)
$$

**The conditional mean formula:**

$$
\mu_{Y \mid X = x} =\mathbb{E}[Y \mid X = x] = \mu_Y + \rho \frac{\sigma_Y}{\sigma_X} (x - \mu_X)
$$

Can be rearranged as:

$$
\mu_{Y \mid X = x}= 
\left( \mu_Y - \rho \frac{\sigma_Y}{\sigma_X} \mu_X \right)
+ 
(\rho \frac{\sigma_Y}{\sigma_X}) x = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
$$

This is the **regression line** derived directly from the **conditional mean**.

So regression is naturally embedded in the bivariate normal distribution.

# Assumptions of Multivariate Regression
---

###  1. **Linearity**

**What it means**:
There should be a straight-line relationship between the inputs (independent variables) and the result (dependent variable).

**What if it’s not true?**
The model will give wrong results because it's trying to fit a straight line to a curved pattern.

**How to check**:

* **Residuals vs Fitted Plot**: If there's a curve, it's not linear.
* **Partial Residual Plot**: Helps show how each variable affects the result.

**Example**:
Predicting salary using years of experience is linear. But predicting salary using age (very young and very old may earn less) may not be linear.

---

### 2. **Independence of Observations**

 **What it means**:
Each observation should be unrelated to the others.

 **What if it’s not true?**
Standard errors become too small, making unimportant predictors look important.

 **How to check**:

* **Durbin-Watson Test**: Detects patterns in data over time.
* **Residual Plot**: Patterns mean values are connected.

 **Example**:
In sales data collected every day, today’s sales may depend on yesterday’s (violates independence).

---

### 3. **Homoscedasticity (Equal Spread of Errors)**

 **What it means**:
Errors (residuals) should have the same spread no matter the value of the inputs.

 **What if it’s not true?**
The model might give more weight to certain data points, leading to incorrect conclusions.

 **How to check**:

* **Residual vs Fitted Plot**: Should be a random cloud. A cone or fan shape indicates a problem.
* **Scale-Location Plot**: Checks if the spread is constant.

 **Example**:
Predicting house prices—if errors are large only for expensive houses, it's a violation.

---

### 4. **Normality of Errors**

 **What it means**:
The errors (residuals) should follow a normal (bell-curve) distribution.

 **What if it’s not true?**
The confidence intervals and p-values might be wrong.

 **How to check**:

* **Q-Q Plot**: Dots should lie on a straight line.
* **Histogram of Residuals**: Should look like a bell curve.

 **Example**:
If your errors are skewed, like only large positive errors, it's not normal.

---

### 5. **No Multicollinearity**

 **What it means**:
The input variables (predictors) shouldn’t be highly related to each other.

 **What if it’s not true?**
It’s hard to know which variable is actually influencing the output, and the model becomes unstable.

 **How to check**:

* **VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)**: Value > 10 is a red flag.
* **Correlation Matrix**: Look for high correlations between inputs.

 **Example**:
Including both height in inches and height in centimeters will cause multicollinearity.

---

### 6. **No Autocorrelation in Residuals**

 **What it means**:
The errors should not follow a pattern over time (or space).

 **What if it’s not true?**
Future predictions, especially in time-series data, will be unreliable.

 **How to check**:

* **Durbin-Watson Test**
* **Residuals Over Time Plot**

 **Example**:
In stock market data, prices today are linked to yesterday’s prices – autocorrelation is common.

---

### 7. **Sufficient Sample Size**

 **What it means**:
You need enough data to build a reliable model.

 **What if it’s not true?**
The model might learn noise (random things) instead of the real pattern—called overfitting.

 **How to check**:

* **Power Analysis**: To estimate needed sample size.

 **Example**:
Trying to predict house prices using only 10 houses is too little—model won’t generalize well.

---

###  8. **Mean of Residuals Should Be Zero**

 **What it means**:
On average, the prediction errors (residuals) should cancel out to zero.

 **What if it’s not true?**
The line may not be the best fit—it's either always over or under-predicting.

 **How to check**:

* Look at the **mean of residuals** after fitting the model.

 **Example**:
If you predict that all students will get 5 marks more than they actually do, the residuals are not centered around 0.

* Both scores are **normally distributed** for given hours
* The effect of hours is **linear**
* Errors have **equal variance**
